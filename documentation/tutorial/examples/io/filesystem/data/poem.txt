Augustus de Morgan’s 1872 “Siphonaptera” poem:

«
  Great fleas have little fleas upon their backs to bite ’em,
  And little fleas have lesser fleas, and so /ad infinitum/.
  And the great fleas themselves, in turn, have greater fleas to go on;
  While these again have greater still, and greater still, and so on.
