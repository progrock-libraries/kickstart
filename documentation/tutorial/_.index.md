# **Kickstart library tutorial**

Kickstart is intended to ease the way for beginners in C++, and helps to shorten example code for those who help others on the net.

## **1. Installation & compiler requirements.**

All you need to do is download, copy and rename, so that the compiler finds the `<kickstart/`&hellip;`>` headers. There is no need to compile the library on its own. All the library code is in headers that you just `#include`.

Installation is described in more detail in [a separate document](../../source/examples/hello-world.md).

Then after installation, to use Kickstart you need to use a compiler option that specifies at least ***C++17***. Also, the Kickstart i/o functionality requires that C++ strings are UTF-8 encoded, which they’re not by default with the 2019 version of Microsoft’s Visual C++ compiler, and the Kickstart code uses the alternate keywords `and`, `or` and `not`, which again are a problem with Visual C++. Recommended options to guide the compilers:

| *Compiler:* | *Recommended core options:* |
|:-|:-|
| g++ &amp; clang | `-std=c++17` `-pedantic-errors` `-Wall` |
| Visual C++ | `/nologo` `/utf-8` `/EHsc` `/GR` `/permissive-` `/FI"iso646.h"` `/std:c++17` `/Zc:__cplusplus` `/W4` `/wd4459` `/D` `_CRT_SECURE_NO_WARNINGS` `/D` `_STL_SECURE_NO_WARNINGS` |

Happily, for Visual C++ options can be specified in environment variable `CL`, which is used automatically.

## **2. “Hello, world!” — or, keep that console window open, please.**

Here’s the classic “Hello, world!” program expressed with Kickstart console output:

*File ([hello-world.cpp](examples/hello-world.cpp)):*
~~~cpp
#include <kickstart/all.hpp>
using namespace kickstart::all;

auto main() -> int
{
    out << "Hello, world!" << endl;
}
~~~

`out`, `<<` and `endl` are names provided by the Kickstart library in namespace `kickstart::all`. When the output goes to a Windows console then it’s sent there via the UTF-16 based Windows API function `WriteConsoleW` so that e.g. non-English letters are treated correctly. In all other cases the `out` output is delegated to C’s `fwrite`.

However, conversion to text of non-textual arguments is handled by passing them to a `std::ostringstream`. That means that C++ iostreams can be be involved and contribute to an unreasonably large executable size, just as with use of `std::cout` output. A future goal is to remove that and *all* dependencies on iostreams so that the size of a C++ “Hello, world!” executable built by a beginner, can be much less unreasonable.

Result in an ordinary Windows console window:

> C:\my\dev\libraries\kickstart-1\documentation\tutorial\examples]  
> \> ***cl hello-world.cpp /Fe"hello"***  
> hello-world.cpp
> 
> [C:\my\dev\libraries\kickstart-1\documentation\tutorial\examples]  
> \> ***hello***  
> Hello, world!

Works! 😃

The **`cl`** command invokes the Visual C++ 2019 compiler, and option `/Fe"hello"` tells it to produce an executable named `hello.exe`, which can then be invoked with command `hello`.

---

Beginners that are learning in Windows, typically insert a “stop here” statement at the end of each program. This keeps the Windows console window open when the program has finished so that the program’s output can be viewed. The stopping statement can be a portable input statement, or it can be e.g. a Windows-specific `system("pause")`, but anyway it’s problematic in several ways:

* It’s *unreliable*: in a typical beginner's program the input buffer may not be empty at the end, so that the execution doesn’t stop at an input statement at the end.
* It’s *unclean*: the `main` code becomes less clean, and with a `system` command also needlessly non-portable.
* It’s *premature*: at the point where the program stops (if it stops), static cleanup has not yet been performed, so any effects from that can’t be observed.
* It’s *annoying*: when the program is run from a command interpreter the user needlessly has to interact with it to terminate it at the end.
* It’s *obstructive*: when the program is used in a script/batch file, including for testing such as measuring the run time, one must work around the stopping behavior.

With Kickstart you can largely avoid the above five problems by instead **force-including** the **`<kickstart/¤-keep-console.hpp>`** header. “Force-including” means that you use a compiler option to include it, instead of an `#include` directive in the code. With Visual C++ it’s option `/FI`, and with g++ it’s `-include`.

> [C:\my\dev\libraries\kickstart-1\documentation\tutorial\examples]  
> \> ***cl hello-world.cpp /FI"kickstart/¤-keep-console.hpp" /Fe"hello"***  
> hello-world.cpp
> 
> [C:\my\dev\libraries\kickstart-1\documentation\tutorial\examples]  
> \> ***hello***  
> Hello, world!

Uhm, hey, it’s just the same as before?!?

Yes, that’s by design. The behavior when the program is run from a command interpreter is exactly the same as before; no change. That supports the last two bullet points above, to not be annoying or obstructive.

But watch what happens when it’s run by double-clicking the executable in Windows Explorer:

![](images/hello-world.shadowed.png "Paused “Hello, world!” console window.")

Yay!

Notes:

1. There’s no guarantee that all relevant static cleanup has been performed at this point, because the stopping is done by the destructor of a global object. For example, an earlier opened file that has not been explicitly closed, may still be open so that it can’t yet be deleted. But all static cleanup performed by object destructors will in practice have been performed.

2. When you just want to keep the console window when you run your program from an IDE such as Visual Studio, then it’s much simpler to use the IDE’s functionality. For example, in Visual Studio run the program via keypress **Ctrl** + **F5**, and for example, in Code::Blocks run the program via keypress **F9**. However, the `<kickstart/¤-keep-console.hpp>` header can still be useful *for debugging* in an IDE, because typically the debugger does not provide a “keep console open” stop at the end.

3. As a workaround for a Code::Blocks bug the library offers a header wrapper **<kickstart/tool-specific/code-blocks/keep-console.hpp>** that one can use in Code::Blocks. The bug: in the author’s testing the Code::Blocks IDE in Ubuntu (and maybe everywhere) just silently *skipped* invoking the compiler, and erroneously reported successful compilation, when the forced include filename had a “¤” in front. Ugh!

---

The Unix version of `<kickstart/¤-keep-console.hpp>` always stops at the end, even when the program is run from a command interpreter:

> [~/dev/libraries/kickstart-1/documentation/tutorial/examples]  
> $ ***OPT="-std=c++17 -pedantic-errors -Wall"***  
> 
> [~/dev/libraries/kickstart-1/documentation/tutorial/examples]  
> $ ***g++ $OPT hello-world.cpp -include "kickstart/¤-keep-console.hpp" -o hello***  
> 
> [~/dev/libraries/kickstart-1/documentation/tutorial/examples]  
> $ ***./hello***  
> Hello, world!  
> ▷ Press Enter to continue: 

This rather primitive but at least reliable behavior is because any practical way to have double-clicking run a program in a terminal window, in Ubuntu, probably involves running the program via a shell such as Bash, so that in general there will be at least one and maybe more other processes attached to the console.

E.g., when the author explored double-clicking of modern g++-produced executables in the Nautilus file explorer in Gnome in Ubuntu, it turned out that “run a modern executable” functionality was not present by default (!), and *creating that functionality* involved some installations (which may or may not have been necessary) plus adding a file “[/usr/local/share/applications/run-in-terminal.desktop](examples/run-in-terminal/ubuntu/run-in-terminal.desktop)” that specified an “Open with” item that invoked a file “[/usr/local/bin/run-in-terminal.sh](examples/run-in-terminal/ubuntu/run-in-terminal.sh)” that, due to apparent bugs in `gnome-terminal`, dynamically created a “/tmp/” shell script to run the program, which script it in turn passed as “`--`”-command to `gnome-terminal`&hellip;

But the Ubuntu/Unix environment enabled a nice little feature, namely that the “Press Enter to continue:” text is presented in subdued gray color:

## **3. Text i/o.**

### **3.1. Output of non-English letters like Norwegian ÆØÅ.**

Pretend that you’re a Norwegian student named Bjørn Håvard Sæther. You want to write a portable C++ program that displays your name, whether you compile and run it in Linux or in Windows. That’s easy with Kickstart:

*File ([bhs.cpp](examples/bhs.cpp)):*
~~~cpp
#include <kickstart/all.hpp>
using namespace kickstart::all;

auto main() -> int
{
    out << "Dear world, Bjørn Håvard Sæther says hello!" << endl;
}
~~~

Output:

> Dear world, Bjørn Håvard Sæther says hello!

---

Here’s code that ideally should do the same, but using the C++ standard library directly:

*File ([bhs.stdlib.cpp](examples/bhs.stdlib.cpp)):*
~~~cpp
#include <iostream>
using namespace std;

auto main() -> int
{
    cout << "Dear world, Bjørn Håvard Sæther says hello!" << endl;
}
~~~

Output in a Windows console, using the defaults on the author’s system:

> Dear world, Bj├©rn H├Ñvard S├ªther says hello!

The gobbledygook appears because the console expects a different text encoding than UTF-8, and because *the Visual C++ standard library implementation does not address that issue*.

This is so also with the other common Windows compilers. The Windows C++ standard library implementations could have done the same as Kickstart, with Just Works&trade; behavior, but they don’t. Presumably that common misbehavior is due to common reuse of a core of flawed functionality in Microsoft’s C runtime library.

---

When one works in a Windows command interpreter, as opposed to running one’s program from an IDE or by double-clicking the executable, then one can use the `chcp` command to tell the console to expect UTF-8 encoding:

> [C:\my\dev\libraries\kickstart-1\documentation\tutorial\examples]  
> \> ***cl bhs.stdlib.cpp /Fe"bhs-stdlib"***  
> bhs.stdlib.cpp  
>  
> [C:\my\dev\libraries\kickstart-1\documentation\tutorial\examples]  
> \> ***chcp & bhs-stdlib***  
> Active code page: 850  
> Dear world, Bj├©rn H├Ñvard S├ªther says hello!
> 
> [C:\my\dev\libraries\kickstart-1\documentation\tutorial\examples]  
> \> ***chcp 65001 & bhs-stdlib***  
> Active code page: 65001  
> Dear world, Bjørn Håvard Sæther says hello!

`chcp` is short for *change codepage*. A **codepage** is a number that identifies a text encoding &mdash; it’s a scheme originally used by IBM, and adopted and adapted by Microsoft, SAS and others. Windows codepage 850 identifies a Scandinavian variant of the original IBM PC text encoding, and Windows codepage 65001 identifies UTF-8.

As of 2021, in Windows 10 codepage 65001 works for UTF-8 *output*, and with [Microsoft Terminal](https://github.com/microsoft/terminal) it even works for emojis 😃, but it doesn’t work for standard stream *input* 😒.

### **3.2. Input of non-English letters like Norwegian ÆØÅ.**

Kickstart only offers input of complete lines of text, at the highest level via a function **`input()`** → `string`.

With the function it’s easier to avoid non-`const` variables, and with the restriction to whole lines it’s easier to avoid the common beginner’s problem that an input buffer contains text from some earlier input operation.

Example:


*File ([personalized-kickstart-greeting.cpp](examples/personalized-kickstart-greeting.cpp)):*
~~~cpp
#include <kickstart/all.hpp>
using namespace kickstart::all;

auto main() -> int
{
    const string name = input( "Hi, what’s your name? " );
    out << "Welcome to the Kickstart experience, " << name << "!" << endl;
}
~~~

Typical result:

> Hi, what’s your name? ***Bjørn Håvard Sæther***  
> Welcome to the Kickstart experience, Bjørn Håvard Sæther!

The above result was obtained in a classic Windows console, showing that Kickstart input deals correctly with non-English characters in this environment.

The code also shows that the `kickstart::all` namespace brings in some select often used identifiers from the standard library; here `string` is `std::string`. The `endl` identifier is however not the one from the standard library. That can possibly be worth being aware of.
